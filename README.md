# rubiks-cube-ida-star-solver
Rubik's Cube Solver (IDA*)
A C++ implementation of a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube solver using the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) search algorithm.

Overview :
This project provides a fully functional Rubik's Cube solver that finds the optimal solution(minimum moves) to transform any valid scrambled cube state into a desired target state.

Features
Full 3x3x3 cube support with customizable start and goal states

IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*) search for optimal solutions

Comprehensive comments and clean code structure

Easy input via text file

Clear move sequence output in standard Rubikâ€™s notation (e.g., R, U', F)

Performance statistics (number of moves, nodes explored)

Error handling for invalid input
